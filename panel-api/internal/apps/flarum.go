// Flarum is the descriptor for Flarum — a modern, lightweight forum
// platform (the successor to esoTalk/FluxBB). RequiresDB=true.
//
// Unlike phpBB/Drupal which ship a rooted tarball, Flarum is normally
// installed via `composer create-project`. We sidestep that by pulling
// the upstream "no-public-dir" prebuilt archive (vendor/ pre-bundled,
// extension-manager included) and running Flarum's headless CLI
// installer (`php flarum install -f <config.yml>`). See the agent's
// flarum_install.go for the download pin + install flow.
//
// Flarum's default layout serves from a public/ subdirectory; the
// no-public-dir variant flattens that so the install root IS the
// webroot. That keeps it inside jabali's docroot+subdir model, but it
// also exposes config.php / storage/ / vendor/ to the web — the agent
// installer writes an nginx deny snippet to block them (the rules from
// Flarum's own .nginx.conf).
//
// Clone is intentionally empty: a clean Flarum clone needs a duplicate
// DB + an assets/ + storage/ rsync + a config.php url rewrite. No live
// ask yet, so AgentCloneCmd stays empty (the Clone button is hidden).
// Delete reuses the generic app.delete (rm -rf the install path) and
// the install row's db_id drives the DB drop, same as phpBB.
